# Research 2d Multiplayer

Hello, some stranger, I'm [nosqd](https://github.com/nosqd) founder of bethetka.ru and we're now developing game 3D FPS 
named ProjectResearch and I'm need some multiplayer framework with features like Server Recon, Lag Comp and other shit,
in this project you can see two CC0 game components:
- Multiplayer Framework (/features/network)
- Console Framework (in /features/console)

You can freely use that in your project.
